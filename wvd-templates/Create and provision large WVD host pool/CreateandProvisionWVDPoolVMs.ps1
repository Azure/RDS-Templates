.SYNOPSIS
    Helps with the deployment of large host pools by automating repeated deployments
.DESCRIPTION
    Helps with the deployment of large host pools by automating repeated deployments.
    This script will iteratively initiate moderately sized deployments that 
    a) Do not exceed the ARM template limit of 800 objects
    b) Should trigger at most moderate ARM throttling
    
.PARAMETER DesiredPoolVMCount
    Count of pool VMs that should exist in the end.
.PARAMETER AllocationBatchSize
    Count of pool VMs to create in a single deployment. For most environments, this limit is 275
.PARAMETER MaxSimultaneousDeployments
    Maximum number of simultaneous deployments.
.PARAMETER ResourceGroupName
    Resource Group name which should be used for the host pool. This will be created if it doesn't exist.
.PARAMETER Location
    Location where the Resource Group should be created if it doesn't exist
.PARAMETER VMNamingPrefix
    Prefix that will be used for the host pool VMs. 
.PARAMETER SleepTimeMinutes
    Sleep time in between deployment attempts. This is forced to 60 seconds on all deployments up to the first MaxSimultaneousDeployments
.PARAMETER IsTest
    If this is set to TRUE, then the resource group has a GUID appended on the end this makes it easy to clean up because you can just 
    delete the resource group and all test VMs will be deleted. NOTE: Deleting the Resource Group will not remove the session host entries.
.PARAMETER DeploymentBatchNamingPrefix
    Prefix for all the deployments from this script. This makes it easier to identify them
.PARAMETER TargetVirtualNetworkName
    Virtual network into which to deploy the host pool VMs. This will be created if it doesn't exist.
.PARAMETER TargetSubnetName
    Subnet into which to deploy the host pool VMs. This will be created if it doesn't exist.
